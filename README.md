# Goal

We want to ensure that our users' passwords follow these rules :

   - Have more than 8 characters
   - Contain an upper case letter
   - Contain a lower case letter
   - Contain a number
   - Contain an underscore

# Hint

This kata shows the importance of :

  - selecting the test order
  - having good assertions 
  	- each assertion validates ONE thing
  	- what is being asserted is ALWAYS true
